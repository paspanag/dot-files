These are my dot files (OS X - Snow Leopard)

Nice to have a proper storage for it incase I screw it up again whenever I play around with it (especially when I play around with vim, it is pretty finicky).

If you want to copy it feel free, it might not work but I will update this README with the list of pathogen plugins I use.
